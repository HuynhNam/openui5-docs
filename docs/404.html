<h3>Did you get here from the OpenUI5 Demo Kit?</h3>
<p> Great, then there's probably an easy explanation: This repository reflects the current development status of the
OpenUI5 documentation. It's not identical to the content of the <a href="https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/topic">OpenUI5 Demo Kit</a>,
which corresponds to the latest officially released documentation. If you choose "Edit on GitHub" for a documentation topic that we have
removed or renamed in the meantime, you end up here. ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>If we have only renamed the documentation topic, you might be able to find it in the table of contents on the left.</p>
