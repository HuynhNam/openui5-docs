### Improved Features


<table>

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   We now provide the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#getMessages` method for use by `sap.ui.model.Context#getMessages`. Both methods can be used to highlight table rows with messages. For more information, see [Highlighting Table Rows with Messages](Server_Messages_in_the_OData_V4_Model_fbe1cb5.md#loiofbe1cb5613cf4a40a841750bf813238e__section_highlighting_table_rows).

-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#refresh` method is now supported for kept-alive contexts. A list binding context can be kept alive with the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setKeepAlive` method introduced with OpenUI5 1.81.
-   When using `groupLevels` with the `$$aggregation` list binding parameter, we now support grand totals.
-   `TargetProperties` of type `edm.String` are supported in accordance with recent changes to the `SideEffectsType` and can be directly provided to the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects` method.
-   You can now set the value of an instance annotation for a newly created or already existing entity. The set value is sent to the back end in a `POST` or `PATCH` request, respectively.

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

**Special Messaging Support for Visually Impaired Users**

The `sap.ui.core.InvisibleMessage` class is no longer experimental. This class is used to programmatically expose dynamic content changes that can be announced by the screen reader. For more information, see [sap.ui.core.InvisibleMessage](sap.ui.core.InvisibleMessage_b9a7d6f.md), the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.InvisibleMessage) and the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.InvisibleMessage).

### Improved Controls


<table>
<tr>
<td>

**`sap.f.GridContainer`**

We have improved the two-dimensional keyboard navigation. Now navigation using the [Arrow Keys\] follows the configurable two-dimensional grid. This model provides stable navigation paths when there are items of different sizes. When the user presses an [Arrow Key\] in a direction outward of the `GridContainer`, a `borderReached` event is fired. The implementation of the `borderReached` event allows the application developer to control where the focus goes and \(depending on the surrounding layout\) to pass the focus to a specific place in a neighboring `GridContainer` using the `GridContainer#focusItemByDirection` method. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.f.GridContainer) and the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.f.GridContainer/sample/sap.f.sample.GridContainersNavigation). 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**`sap.m.Bar`**

We have added a new `titleAlignment` property. It enables developers to create custom headers for controls that use headers based on `sap.m.Bar` and to achieve proper title alignment. To keep the default `Bar` behavior \(when it is not used as a header\), we have added a new value `None` \(default\) to the `sap.m.TitleAlignment` enumeration. If the `titleAlignment` value is set to `Start` or `Center`, the horizontal alignment of the `contentMiddle` aggregation of `sap.m.Bar` accepts the same setting. If the `titleAlignment` is set to `Auto`, the `contentMiddle` aggregation is set according to the default theme setting. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.Bar).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**`sap.m.ColorPalette`, `sap.m.ColorPalettePopover`, and `sap.ui.unified.ColorPickerPopover`**

A `liveChange` event is now available in these controls, which are using the `sap.ui.unified.ColorPicker` internally. This event is used to propagate real-time color changes from inside the `ColorPicker` before closing the popover that contains this `ColorPicker`. For more information, see the [ColorPickerPopover](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.ui.unified.ColorPicker/sample/sap.ui.unified.sample.ColorPickerPopover) and the [ColorPalettePopover](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.m.ColorPalette/sample/sap.m.sample.ColorPalettePopover) samples.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**`sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar`**

The `specialDates` aggregation, which allows you to define special dates for the control, is now visible in the Month view for all supported SAP themes. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**`sap.m.Table`**

> ### Caution:  
> This feature is no longer in place as of 1.85.1. as the default behavior . For more information , see the What’s New in 1.86 and the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.Table) for `fixedLayout`. 

If the sum of the width of all columns in a table is less than the available space for the whole table, we now render a placeholder column to occupy the remaining unused space.This feature is enabled by default.

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   You can now configure the `min-height` of the content within Analytical and Component cards. To achieve this, add the `“minHeight”: “<*CSS value*>”` property to the `content` section of the manifest. For more information, see the [Analytical Card](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/analytical) and [Component Card](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/component) sections in the Card Explorer.

-   We have added a new `actionDefinitions` \(experimental\) aggregation. It defines the action buttons that appear in the card-header menu. The `actionDefinitions` is of type `sap.ui.integation.ActionDefinition`, which allows developers to add, remove, or modify the actions at any time. This aggregation replaces the \(deprecated\) `actions` property of `sap.ui.integration.Extension`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card/Aggregations) in the Demo Kit and the [Extension](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/extension/customActions) and [Component Card](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/component/customActions) samples in the Card Explorer.
